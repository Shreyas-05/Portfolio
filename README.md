# [Project 1: Sales Forecast (Time Series) - Rossmann Data](https://github.com/Shreyas-05/Sales-Forecasting-Rossmann)
> Rossmann is a European drug distributor which operates over 3,000 drug stores across seven European countries. Since a lot of drugs come with a short shelf life, that is, they do not have a long expiry date, it becomes imperative for Rossmann to accurately forecast sales at their individual stores. Currently, the forecasting is taken care of by the store managers who are tasked with forecasting daily sales for the next six weeks.

### Approach:
1. Perform decomposition on Store level of the data to identify trends and seasonality.
2. ADF test to test the Stationarity of the Time Series.
3. ACF and PCF to understand the Order of lags to be used.
4. Use VAR and VARMAX to forecast the next 6 weeks of Sales.


# [Project 2: Geely-Auto Regression Problem](https://github.com/Shreyas-05/Geely-Auto-Regression)
Automobile Case Study using Linear Regression in Python

### Problem Statement
> A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts.

# [Project 3: Loan Case Study - EDA](https://github.com/Shreyas-05/EDA)

* In this case study, apart from applying the techniques of EDA, we will have a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

# [Project 4: Customer Churn](https://github.com/Shreyas-05/Customer-Churn)
Performing PCA to reduce components and applying different classification techniques.

**What has been done in the project?**
* Preprocess data (convert columns to appropriate formats, handle missing values, etc.)
* Conduct appropriate exploratory analysis to extract useful insights (whether directly useful for business or for eventual modelling/feature engineering).
* Derive new features.
* Reduce the number of variables using PCA.
* Train a ***Random Forest, Logistic Regression and XGBOOST*** models, tune model hyperparameters, etc. (handle class imbalance using appropriate techniques).
* Evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics. Note that is is more important to identify churners than the non-churners accurately - choose an appropriate evaluation metric which reflects this business goal.
* Finally, choose a model based on some evaluation metric.
